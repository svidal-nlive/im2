# **Service 8: Audio-Recon — Complete Sub-Flow Breakdown (PRD)**

## **Audio-Recon Service: Functional Flows & Requirements**

### **A. Input Reception & Validation**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|RECON-001|Receive all separated stems and metadata/artwork from Spleeter/Demucs|As a system, I want to recombine only complete, validated job artifacts.|Service only accepts jobs with all expected stems, metadata, and trace info (job_uuid, user_id, engine/version).|
|RECON-002|Validate input completeness and contract compliance|As a developer, I want to ensure all required stems and metadata/art are present before starting recombination.|If any required input is missing/incomplete/corrupt, job is failed and surfaced with detailed error for diagnostics.|

### **B. Recombination & Output Assembly**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|RECON-003|Recombine separated stems into deliverable audio as configured|As a user, I want my files reassembled into desired output (e.g., full mix, karaoke, stem sets).|Output is generated per job config (all stems, vocals-only, instrumentals, etc.), matching user/system preferences.|
|RECON-004|Apply all extracted and enriched metadata to output files|As a user, I want all my tags/art preserved and restored on final audio.|All output files are tagged with original/enriched metadata and attached artwork, conforming to schema/contract.|
|RECON-005|Embed artwork, compliance, and traceability tags|As a user, I want my cover art and compliance info visible on my final files.|Artwork and compliance markers (e.g., GDPR tags, schema version, trace_id) are embedded in all relevant outputs.|
|RECON-006|Support multiple output formats/configurations as needed (e.g., MP3, FLAC, WAV)|As a user, I want to select output format for compatibility.|User/system output format preferences are honored and validated; all outputs conform to user-config or system default.|

### **C. Idempotency, Atomicity, and Error Handling**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|RECON-007|Ensure atomic output generation (no partial files on crash)|As a user, I want only complete files produced—never corrupt/partial on failure.|Outputs are written/moved atomically; incomplete/interrupted jobs are recoverable or flagged as error, never left partial.|
|RECON-008|Idempotent recombination for retries or replays|As an operator, I want to be able to safely rerun jobs without duplicating or corrupting outputs.|The process can be rerun/replayed with same result, overwriting or cleaning up prior attempts as needed.|
|RECON-009|Surface all errors (missing stem, tag, artwork, recombination failure) with explicit code and remedy|As a user, I want clear reasons for any failure, and what can be done.|All errors are logged and surfaced to UI/Queue with actionable message and trace_id/job_uuid.|

### **D. Output Handoff & Directory Structure**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|RECON-010|Output atomic, organized files to output/ with correct directory and naming|As a user, I want my outputs organized for easy use (e.g., Artist/Album/Song).|All files are named and placed in output/ tree by Artist/Album/Song or configured convention, with all required metadata.|
|RECON-011|Update job state in Queue and log final output with traceability|As an operator, I want every successful/failed output tracked and surfaced in monitoring.|Queue is updated, logs are written with output locations, sizes, job_uuid, and any compliance/retention info.|
|RECON-012|Move failed/incomplete outputs to orphan/ for later review|As an operator, I want to keep incomplete/failed outputs for audit and debugging.|Orphaned/corrupt outputs are moved to orphan/ with error reason and full traceability for later cleanup or manual fix.|

### **E. Observability, Metrics & Alerts**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|RECON-013|Structured logging for all recombination actions and outcomes|As an operator, I want full traceability for every output and error in recombination.|All steps (input validation, output creation, tagging, errors) are logged with job_uuid, user_id, trace_id.|
|RECON-014|`/health` and `/metrics` endpoints expose recombination throughput, error rates, and output stats|As an ops engineer, I want real-time monitoring and alerting for Audio-Recon service.|Metrics include jobs processed, error codes, latency, output file counts, orphan rate, etc.|
|RECON-015|Alerts on high failure, output corruption, or repeated job aborts|As an operator, I want immediate notification for system or job-level issues.|Configurable alerts are triggered for failure spikes, output corruption, or repeated errors.|

### **F. Security, Compliance, and Retention**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|RECON-016|Enforce per-user/job quotas on output (size, count, formats)|As an admin, I want no user/job to produce excessive outputs or misuse resources.|Output size/count/formats are checked against per-user/job quotas; jobs over quota are flagged or rejected.|
|RECON-017|Tag outputs with compliance/retention markers, enforce right-to-delete|As a user, I want my outputs handled per legal/privacy policy, and deleted if I request.|All outputs/logs are tagged for compliance, retention period, and right-to-delete; deletions cascade on request.|

## **Audio-Recon Service — Complete Flow Diagram (Text)**

1. **Receives complete job**: stems from Spleeter/Demucs, all tags/artwork from Metadata.
    
2. Validates input completeness and contract; fails jobs with missing/corrupt inputs and logs reason.
    
3. Recombines stems as per job/system config (e.g., full mix, karaoke, custom stem sets).
    
4. Applies all metadata/artwork and compliance markers; supports multiple output formats as required.
    
5. Writes all output files atomically; ensures idempotency and recovers from partials/crashes.
    
6. Organizes outputs in correct directory structure (output/Artist/Album/Song).
    
7. Updates Queue with completion status, logs all actions and output details.
    
8. Moves failed/incomplete outputs to orphan/ for audit/debugging.
    
9. Exposes `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints for service status and output monitoring.
    
10. Triggers alerts on high error, output corruption, or repeated failures.
    
11. Fully enforces quotas, retention, GDPR, and right-to-delete on all outputs/artifacts.
