# **Service 12: Notifications — Complete Sub-Flow Breakdown (PRD)**

## **Notifications Service: Functional Flows & Requirements**

### **A. Event Reception & Routing**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|NOTIFY-001|Receive notification events from all services (job error, completion, incident, quota)|As a user or operator, I want all important pipeline events surfaced in a timely, reliable way.|Notification service subscribes to pipeline events (via pub/sub or webhook), with job_uuid/user_id, event type, severity, and payload.|
|NOTIFY-002|Route events to appropriate channel(s): email, webhook, on-call, UI, etc.|As a user/admin, I want to receive each event through my preferred or configured channel(s).|Each event is routed per user, system, and event-type config: SMTP, webhook, PagerDuty, UI in-app, etc.|
|NOTIFY-003|Support channel-level configuration and user opt-in/out|As a user, I want to choose which notifications I get and how.|Users can manage preferences for channel, event types, and frequency; defaults can be set system-wide.|

### **B. Delivery, Retry, and Backoff**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|NOTIFY-004|Reliable delivery with retry and exponential backoff on failure|As an operator, I want to be sure notifications are delivered even if there’s a temporary failure.|On delivery failure (e.g., SMTP or webhook down), events are retried with exponential backoff; all retries logged.|
|NOTIFY-005|Deduplicate repeated notifications to prevent user/admin spam|As a user or responder, I want only one notification per unique event/incident.|Service deduplicates repeated events within a defined time window; only sends unique notifications for the same job/error.|
|NOTIFY-006|Rate limiting for high-volume events or notification floods|As an operator, I want to prevent notification floods during system-wide incidents.|Rate limits can be set per user, per channel, per event type; overruns are logged and surfaced as warnings in metrics/UI.|

### **C. Escalation and Incident Response**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|NOTIFY-007|Integrate with PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or ticketing system for incidents|As an on-call responder, I want critical pipeline failures to page or create tickets automatically.|Critical severity events trigger escalation (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Jira, etc.), following escalation rules and on-call schedules.|
|NOTIFY-008|Document and trigger incident response playbooks as part of notification flow|As an ops lead, I want every critical incident to trigger the correct playbook and be auditable.|Incident notifications link or trigger documented response playbooks, with audit trail and step tracking.|

### **D. Templating, Internationalization, and Accessibility**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|NOTIFY-009|Use customizable templates for all notification types and channels|As an admin, I want consistent, branded, and clear messages for every event type.|All notifications use customizable templates, supporting branding, custom fields, and context for each event/channel.|
|NOTIFY-010|Support i18n for all notifications and templates|As a user in any locale, I want to receive messages in my language or local convention.|Notifications/templates support string externalization, locale detection, and formatting for date/time/numbers.|
|NOTIFY-011|Ensure notifications are accessible (a11y) across all supported channels|As a user with disabilities, I want to receive accessible alerts.|Email and UI notifications are formatted for screen readers and high-contrast, with alt text for any media or links.|

### **E. Compliance, Privacy, and Auditability**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|NOTIFY-012|Respect user privacy, preferences, and opt-out for non-critical alerts|As a user, I want to only receive alerts I consented to, except for compliance/critical notices.|User notification preferences are enforced; opt-outs respected except where legal/compliance requires override (e.g., right-to-delete confirmation).|
|NOTIFY-013|Audit log for all notifications sent, delivered, failed, or suppressed|As an operator/compliance officer, I want full auditability for every notification.|Every notification event (queued, sent, failed, retried, suppressed) is logged with timestamp, user/channel, and result.|
|NOTIFY-014|Provide notification history to user (via UI or API)|As a user, I want to review all alerts/notifications I’ve received.|UI/API provides user-accessible notification history, filterable by event type, status, and time.|

### **F. Observability, Metrics, and Health**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|NOTIFY-015|`/health` and `/metrics` endpoints for notification volume, errors, latency|As an ops engineer, I want to monitor health and delivery stats for all channels.|Metrics show per-channel notification volume, errors, retries, dedupes, delivery latency, opt-out rate, etc.|
|NOTIFY-016|Alert on persistent delivery failures, channel downtime, or alerting system misconfiguration|As an operator, I want to know if notifications are being lost or blocked.|System monitors and alerts on persistent failures, downtime, or misconfigured notification endpoints.|

### **G. Configuration and Toggling**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|NOTIFY-017|Environment/config toggles to disable/enable notifications per channel (e.g., for dev/test)|As an operator, I want to disable notifications for test/dev deployments.|Environment flags or config values allow toggling notification delivery per channel or globally, with confirmation banner/log.|
|NOTIFY-018|Live reload of notification config, templates, or escalation rules|As an admin, I want to update notification settings/templates/escalations without downtime.|Notification service supports live reload of config and templates, with validation and rollback on error.|

## **Notifications Service — Complete Flow Diagram (Text)**

1. **Receives event** from any service (job status, error, completion, incident, quota).
    
2. Looks up event type, user/system/channel routing, user preferences, and escalation policies.
    
3. Formats notification using customizable template, locale, and a11y rules.
    
4. Sends notification to one or more channels (email, webhook, PagerDuty, UI, etc.).
    
5. Retries on failure, applies backoff, deduplicates repeat events, and rate-limits as needed.
    
6. Escalates to on-call/ticketing systems for critical incidents; triggers/links to incident playbooks.
    
7. Logs every notification sent, failed, or suppressed, and updates user-accessible notification history.
    
8. Supports opt-in/out, privacy, and compliance for all non-critical alerts.
    
9. Provides `/health` and `/metrics` for system status; triggers alerts on failure, misconfig, or downtime.
    
10. All configuration and templates can be live-reloaded or toggled (e.g., disable for dev).
