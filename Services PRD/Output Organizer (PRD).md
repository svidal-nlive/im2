# **Service 9: Output Organizer — Complete Sub-Flow Breakdown (PRD)**

## **Output Organizer Service: Functional Flows & Requirements**

### **A. Output Reception & Validation**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|ORG-001|Receive finalized outputs from Audio-Recon|As a system, I want to only organize jobs that have passed all previous stages and are contract-valid.|Only complete, validated outputs with required metadata, tags, job_uuid, and user_id are accepted for organization.|
|ORG-002|Validate output completeness and directory correctness|As a developer, I want to ensure no incomplete or misplaced files are organized.|Jobs missing files or with incorrect directories are flagged, surfaced as error, and moved to orphan/ for review.|

### **B. Directory Structure & File Naming**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|ORG-003|Organize outputs in Plex/Jellyfin-ready structure (Artist/Album/Song)|As a user, I want my audio files organized for instant use in my media server.|Output files are placed in output/Artist/Album/Song with correct file names and directory depth for media server import.|
|ORG-004|Apply custom file/directory naming conventions (per user/job/system config)|As a user/admin, I want to customize how files are named/organized.|Naming/organization supports per-user/system config, with defaults and validation of results.|
|ORG-005|Prevent name collisions, enforce atomic moves, and deduplicate outputs|As a system, I want to avoid overwriting or duplicating outputs.|Name collisions are resolved via config (e.g., appending index/uuid); all file moves are atomic, with deduplication by job_uuid.|

### **C. Cleanup, Orphan/Corrupt Detection & Pruning**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|ORG-006|Detect and move orphaned, partial, or corrupt files to orphan/|As an operator, I want all incomplete, failed, or corrupt outputs segregated for review/cleanup.|Files failing checks (incomplete, corrupt, not matching contract) are atomically moved to orphan/ with error reason and traceability.|
|ORG-007|Support scheduled and on-demand prune operations with dry-run|As an operator, I want to safely clean up old or orphaned files, previewing changes before deleting.|Scheduled and CLI-triggered prune jobs scan for orphans/old files, with dry-run mode showing what would be deleted before action.|
|ORG-008|Alert/notify on excessive orphan/corrupt files|As an ops engineer, I want to be notified if the rate or count of orphans/corrupts is high.|Configurable thresholds trigger alerts/notifications; all such files are surfaced in monitoring/UI.|

### **D. Quota Enforcement & Alerts**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|ORG-009|Enforce per-user, per-job, and global storage quotas|As an admin, I want to control resource use and prevent bloat.|Organizer checks all file moves/creates against per-user, per-job, and system-wide quotas; violations block further output and trigger error/alert.|
|ORG-010|Alert on nearing quota thresholds (user/system)|As a user/admin, I want to be warned before hitting quota, not after.|Alerts are triggered as quotas are approached, surfaced in UI and via notifications; jobs can be paused, retried, or failed based on policy.|
|ORG-011|Prevent output if quota exceeded, with explicit error|As a user, I want a clear error if my job cannot be completed due to quota.|Jobs that would exceed quota are failed gracefully, surfaced to UI/Queue, and not partially written.|

### **E. Pruning & Safe Deletion**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|ORG-012|Scheduled/prioritized pruning of old/unused outputs (configurable by age, type, user/job)|As an admin, I want to automatically remove unneeded files without manual intervention.|Pruning jobs can be scheduled by age, type, or user; policy is configurable and actions logged/audited.|
|ORG-013|“Dry-run”/preview for all destructive actions|As an operator, I want to see what will be deleted before actual deletion.|Dry-run mode lists all affected files/directories, with no changes, and outputs summary to logs/UI.|
|ORG-014|Safe, atomic deletion with error rollback|As a developer, I want no data loss or partial deletes even if errors or interruptions occur.|Deletes are atomic; on failure/interruption, no partial deletion occurs, and rollback/undo is supported for critical actions.|

### **F. Observability, Metrics & Health**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|ORG-015|Structured, centralized logging for all organization, cleanup, and pruning actions|As an operator, I want full traceability for every file move, prune, or error.|All actions logged with job_uuid, user_id, trace_id, file path, and result.|
|ORG-016|`/health` and `/metrics` endpoints for output/organization stats|As an ops engineer, I want to monitor output organization, orphan rate, prune actions, and quota usage.|Endpoints show file moves, storage use, orphans found/pruned, errors, quota utilization, etc.|
|ORG-017|Alert on high error/prune rates, failed deletions, or quota violations|As an operator, I want real-time notification of issues in output organization.|Configurable alerts on thresholds for errors, prune failures, or quota events, surfaced in monitoring/UI.|

### **G. Security, Compliance & Retention**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|ORG-018|Tag all outputs with compliance/retention markers|As a user, I want my outputs to be retained or deleted based on policy.|Every output file has clear compliance/retention tags, inherited from job and user config.|
|ORG-019|Enforce right-to-delete and GDPR flows for outputs|As a user, I want to be able to delete my outputs and ensure all traces are removed if I request.|Deletion requests (API/UI/CLI) cascade to all organized outputs; compliance is logged and enforced.|

## **Output Organizer Service — Complete Flow Diagram (Text)**

1. **Receives outputs** from Audio-Recon, validates files, directories, and metadata.
    
2. Organizes outputs into output/ tree, using Plex/Jellyfin-ready or custom structure.
    
3. Resolves name collisions and deduplicates, enforcing atomic file moves and correct quotas.
    
4. Detects orphaned, partial, or corrupt files, moves them to orphan/ with trace and error code.
    
5. Performs scheduled or on-demand pruning of old, unused, or orphaned files, always supporting dry-run.
    
6. Checks all actions against per-user, per-job, and global storage quotas; surfaces alerts/warnings as needed.
    
7. Logs all actions, exposes `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints, triggers alerts on errors, or quota/prune problems.
    
8. Tags all outputs for compliance/retention; enforces right-to-delete and GDPR requirements.
    
9. Supports safe, atomic, auditable deletion of outputs, with rollback on failure.
