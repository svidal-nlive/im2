# **Service 3: Queue (Job Management) — Complete Sub-Flow Breakdown (PRD)**

## **Queue Service: Functional Flows & Requirements**

### **A. Job Insertion & State Initialization**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|QUEUE-001|Atomic insertion of new job (with metadata, versioning)|As a system, I want every job inserted to the queue to be fully initialized with required metadata and version info.|Jobs are inserted with job_uuid, user_id, trace_id, schema version, initial state, and creation timestamp.|
|QUEUE-002|Detect and reject duplicate job_uuid on insertion|As an operator, I want to ensure the same job is never queued twice.|Duplicate job_uuids are rejected with an explicit error and reason; existing job is not overwritten.|
|QUEUE-003|Tag job with compliance/privacy and user configuration|As a compliance admin, I want each job to carry legal/privacy attributes.|Jobs are tagged (GDPR, retention, user config) on insert; downstream services can enforce or audit these tags.|

### **B. Job State Management & Transitions**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|QUEUE-004|State machine with strict state transitions|As a developer, I want all job state changes to follow defined rules (e.g., pending → processing → completed/failed).|State changes only occur via validated transitions; illegal transitions are rejected and logged.|
|QUEUE-005|Advisory locks for concurrent job processing|As an ops engineer, I want to prevent double-processing or race conditions in job consumption.|Job state transitions are protected with advisory locks; only one consumer can process a job at a time.|
|QUEUE-006|Timed state expiration and stuck job detection|As an operator, I want to detect jobs stuck in a non-terminal state for too long.|Jobs are flagged as "stuck" if not progressed within configured timeout; alerts are triggered and surfaced in metrics/UI.|

### **C. Error Handling, Retry & Replay**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|QUEUE-007|Capture and store error code, reason, and traceback for failed jobs|As a user, I want to know exactly why my job failed at any stage.|Failed jobs are stored with full error code, reason, traceback, and affected stage.|
|QUEUE-008|Expose retry and replay interface (API/CLI/UI)|As a user or operator, I want to retry failed jobs from last known good state.|Jobs can be retried/replayed with correct state reset; new state transitions and errors are logged and visible.|
|QUEUE-009|Prevent replay/duplicate of jobs in terminal (completed/abandoned) state without explicit override|As an ops engineer, I want to avoid accidental replay of finished or abandoned jobs.|Replays are only allowed with explicit override for completed/abandoned jobs; all replays are logged.|
|QUEUE-010|Rate limiting and backoff for repeated job failures|As an operator, I want to prevent infinite retry loops and alert on repeated errors.|Repeatedly failing jobs are rate-limited, flagged, and surfaced in alerts; further retries require manual action.|

### **D. Schema Versioning, Migration & Rollback**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|QUEUE-011|Track schema version per job and queue|As a devops, I want to ensure forward/backward compatibility during upgrades.|Each job record and queue instance includes schema version; migration status is tracked.|
|QUEUE-012|Automated migration and rollback support for schema changes|As an operator, I want to upgrade or roll back queue schema without downtime or data loss.|Migration scripts are tested and can be run with dry-run and full rollback; schema state is logged and versioned.|
|QUEUE-013|Canary/test queue stage for new schema deployments|As a devops, I want to test new queue versions on a subset of jobs before full rollout.|Canary queue/stage is available; new jobs can be routed for canary validation before general availability.|

### **E. Pausable Pipeline & Safe Upgrade**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|QUEUE-014|Pause/resume all job processing at queue level|As an operator, I want to safely pause the pipeline for upgrades or investigations.|Queue exposes pause/resume command/API; no new jobs are consumed while paused, but jobs can be inspected and managed.|
|QUEUE-015|Safe state sync and checkpoint before upgrades|As an operator, I want to checkpoint queue state before upgrades or rollbacks.|Queue can create and restore from checkpoints; all state changes are logged.|
|QUEUE-016|Resume jobs seamlessly after upgrade/rollback|As a user, I want my jobs to pick up where they left off after an upgrade.|Pipeline resumes from last checkpoint; job state and order are preserved.|

### **F. Observability, Metrics & Health**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|QUEUE-017|Structured logging of all job state changes, with job_uuid, user_id, trace_id|As an operator, I want full traceability for all state transitions.|All job actions (insert, state change, retry, error, etc.) are logged in structured JSON.|
|QUEUE-018|`/health` and `/metrics` endpoints|As an ops engineer, I want to monitor job counts, queue depth, error rates, stuck jobs, etc.|Endpoints expose real-time stats, including pending, processing, failed, and stuck jobs.|
|QUEUE-019|Alert on high queue depth, slow processing, or state transition errors|As an operator, I want alerts for backlog, slowness, or malfunctioning consumers.|Configurable thresholds trigger alerts/notifications, surfaced in UI and dashboards.|

### **G. Security, Multi-Tenancy & Compliance**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|QUEUE-020|RBAC and per-user/job isolation|As an admin, I want each user's jobs to be isolated and only visible to authorized actors.|Queue enforces RBAC on all API/CLI access; jobs are segregated and filtered per user/tenant.|
|QUEUE-021|Per-user/job quotas for queue insertion and retention|As an admin, I want to prevent individual users from monopolizing queue resources.|Queue enforces per-user/job quotas on inserts and retention; violations are surfaced with explicit error codes.|
|QUEUE-022|GDPR/data retention and right-to-delete compliance|As a user, I want the option to delete all my job records/data.|Queue supports per-user data retention; right-to-delete requests remove all traces per legal requirements.|

## **Queue Service — Complete Flow Diagram (Text)**

1. **Receives job insertion request** (from Categorizer), validates metadata, schema version, and job uniqueness.
    
2. Initializes job state, tags with compliance/privacy and user configuration.
    
3. Manages job state via strict state machine; transitions occur only via valid paths.
    
4. Handles state transitions with advisory locks to prevent concurrent/duplicate processing.
    
5. Exposes retry, replay, and error handling (with detailed codes, tracebacks, state reset).
    
6. Supports automated schema migrations, rollbacks, and canary/test queue.
    
7. Allows pipeline pausing/resume, checkpointing, and seamless post-upgrade recovery.
    
8. Logs all actions/changes with full structured trace.
    
9. Monitors and surfaces queue health, metrics, and alerts.
    
10. Enforces security, quotas, and GDPR retention/deletion.
    
11. Recovers/reconciles jobs on crash or restart, preserving job state and trace.
