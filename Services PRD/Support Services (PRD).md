# **Service 13: Support Services — Complete Sub-Flow Breakdown (PRD)**

---

## **A. Postgres (Database) Service**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|PG-001|Provide reliable, persistent data storage for jobs, queue, config, and audit|As a pipeline, I want all critical state tracked in a robust, ACID-compliant database.|All job, user, state, and config data is stored in Postgres, with schema versioning and backup.|
|PG-002|Automated, scheduled backups (full and incremental)|As an operator, I want to prevent data loss and enable rapid disaster recovery.|Backups run on schedule (configurable), stored off-host if required, and can be restored with scripts.|
|PG-003|Testable, documented backup/restore flows with periodic fire drills|As an ops team, I want to verify recovery works and that staff know the process.|Restore is documented, tested on schedule, and logs outcome; “fire drill” runs can be simulated and audited.|
|PG-004|Support online schema migration and rollback with versioning|As a developer/ops, I want to safely upgrade schema without downtime or data loss.|Schema migrations are online, versioned, reversible, and logged, with dry-run option.|
|PG-005|Enforce RBAC, least privilege, and encrypted connections|As a security officer, I want only necessary users/services to access DB, and only securely.|Database access is limited per-service/user with strict RBAC, encrypted connections (SSL/TLS), and no public exposure.|
|PG-006|Monitor health, performance, and storage usage (with alerts)|As an operator, I want to catch slow queries, outages, or capacity issues early.|Monitored for uptime, latency, locks, bloat, and storage; alerting thresholds are set for all KPIs.|
|PG-007|Expose `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints for status, usage, and errors|As an ops engineer, I want to integrate DB health into dashboards.|Database exposes Prometheus-compatible endpoints via sidecar/agent, or logs/metrics are exported to monitoring system.|

## **B. Redis (Pub/Sub, Cache, Coordination) Service**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|REDIS-001|In-memory pub/sub for job events and notifications|As a system, I want low-latency event propagation between services.|All pipeline events/notifications are distributed via Redis pub/sub, with delivery status tracked.|
|REDIS-002|Fast, consistent caching for hot data (e.g., session, metadata cache)|As a developer, I want to cache frequently used data for speed and scalability.|Pipeline services use Redis for user session, cover-art, or metadata caches, with TTL and eviction.|
|REDIS-003|Job/queue coordination (locks, state, quotas, rate limits)|As an operator, I want Redis to coordinate jobs, enforce limits, and prevent races.|Redis is used for advisory locks, per-user quotas, rate limiting (token bucket), and job fencing.|
|REDIS-004|Automated backup (if persistent) and disaster recovery|As an ops engineer, I want Redis data preserved/restorable if needed.|If Redis persistence is enabled, backups run on schedule, restore is documented/tested; otherwise, all persistent state is externalized.|
|REDIS-005|Protect against data loss on crash (AOF, snapshot, config)|As a developer, I want durable cache where needed, and safety in design.|Redis is configured for appropriate durability (AOF/snapshot/off) per role; critical data is persisted elsewhere if not durable.|
|REDIS-006|Secure configuration, with access control and encryption in transit|As a security officer, I want to prevent unauthorized access to Redis data.|Redis is only accessible on trusted networks, with ACL/password, TLS support as available, and no public exposure.|
|REDIS-007|Monitor availability, latency, and error rates with `/metrics`|As an ops engineer, I want live stats for Redis in dashboards.|Redis exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics for up/down, ops/sec, memory, evictions, errors, and alerts on threshold.|

## **C. Traefik (Proxy, Auth, SSL, Routing) Service**

|Req ID|Description|User Story|Expected Behavior/Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|TRAEFIK-001|Route all inbound HTTP(S) traffic securely to internal services|As an operator, I want one entry point to all API/UI endpoints, with full routing and SSL.|Traefik routes all inbound traffic, handling TLS, routing, header injection, and health checks.|
|TRAEFIK-002|Automated certificate management and SSL/TLS renewal|As a security officer, I want all external connections encrypted, and certs always current.|Traefik manages SSL certs (e.g., Let’s Encrypt), handles automated renewal, supports custom certs if needed.|
|TRAEFIK-003|Support RBAC, authentication, and signed API token handling at ingress|As an admin, I want Traefik to enforce auth on all endpoints where possible.|Traefik integrates with backend auth, supports RBAC and API tokens, and can block/route requests by identity/role.|
|TRAEFIK-004|Enforce IP allow/deny lists, rate limiting, and abuse/threat blocking|As an ops/security engineer, I want Traefik to help block attacks and overuse.|Configurable IP whitelisting, deny-lists, rate limits, and WAF features are enabled; all events logged.|
|TRAEFIK-005|Zero-downtime config reload and blue/green deployment support|As a developer/ops, I want to update routing without downtime.|Traefik supports live config reloads and routes new/old traffic for safe deployment/upgrade cycles.|
|TRAEFIK-006|Observability: access logs, request tracing, `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints|As an operator, I want to monitor all ingress traffic and health.|Traefik logs all requests, emits access logs and request traces, and exposes health/metrics endpoints for dashboards.|
|TRAEFIK-007|Compliance with privacy, retention, and audit requirements for logs|As a compliance officer, I want all access logs, traces, and events retained per policy, with right-to-delete.|Logs/traces are retained, purged, or provided for audit per compliance/retention configs, respecting user right-to-delete and GDPR.|

## **Support Services — Complete Flow Diagram (Text)**

1. **Postgres**:
    
    - Stores all persistent state, jobs, configs, audit logs.
        
    - Provides backup/restore, schema migration/rollback, RBAC, encrypted access, and `/metrics` for monitoring.
        
2. **Redis**:
    
    - Publishes/subscribes to job events and notifications; acts as cache for sessions/metadata.
        
    - Provides locks/quotas/rate limits for pipeline coordination, and can persist/restore state if enabled.
        
3. **Traefik**:
    
    - Routes all incoming traffic, manages SSL/TLS, supports RBAC and rate limiting.
        
    - Reloads config live, supports blue/green upgrades, and logs/monitors all ingress.
        
4. **All Services**:
    
    - Integrated with backup, disaster recovery, monitoring, compliance, and right-to-delete flows.
